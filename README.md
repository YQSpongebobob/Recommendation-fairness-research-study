Recommendation fairness research
Recommendation systems founded on graph neural networks (GNN) have been extensively employed
 because of their exceptional recommendation efficiency. Nevertheless, numerous recommendation
 biases also crop up, We have observed that delicate details such as gender and age are frequently
 implicitly apprehended by recommendation systems, culminating in unfair recommendations, and the
 associated algorithms of GNN will magnify this bias. To tackle these difficulties, this paper puts forth a
 method of introducing the notion of causal fairness into the issue of fairness in GNN-based recommen
dation systems, to accomplish counterfactual fairness of user-sensitive information and thereby attain
 unbiased recommendations. Specifically, given a GNN-based recommendation system model, which is
 implemented in our devised fairness framework, chiefly obtaining equitable effects through two facets:
 (1) attaining user embedding fairness through the counterfactual fairness technique; (2) mitigating
 the prejudiced impact caused by the GNN algorithm using the proposed central association subgraph
 method. The amalgamation of these two facets ultimately delivers unbiased recommendations. The
 effectiveness and sophistication of our proposed method for mitigating partiality problems in GNN
 recommendation systems from a causal perspective (MGRC) have been proven via experiments on
 four real-world datasets.
